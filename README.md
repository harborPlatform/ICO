## Harbor crowdsale contract

![](img/HBRCrowdsaleContractor01.png "Harbor Token Crowdsale Contract structure")

### HBRAsetsETH
It manages assets of Harbor Token. The managed assets can be exchanged in the proportion to the volume of issued Harbor Tokens.

### HBRFrozenAssets
It is a contract to control the currency volume of HBR. It can increase supply temporarily but the increased supply will not be distributed. It will be burnt eventually.
Currency can be issued for the purpose of allotting or controlling the supply.
 
If the value of an asset stored in an asset contract rises sharply, it can temporarily increase the volume of money to reduce the impact of asset value volatility and prevent large-scale bank runs.
It reduces volatility and increases security by increasing the currency volume through issuing currency at the time of rise and burning it at the time of fall.

### HBRExchangeETH
It is the currency issuance contract that is associated with the asset contract. It manages Harbor Token issuance conditions. It consists of information such as the exchange rate and the period of time at the time of purchase, and the assets used in the purchase are transferred to the asset contract.

### HBRIdentification
It is for KYC and AML policies and manages user wallet account information.
To purchase more than a certain amount of HBR tokens, it must be authorized by the user. The authorization information will be stored in a separate server.
